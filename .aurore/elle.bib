  abstract = {Continuum Mechanics of Solids is an introductory text for graduate students in the many branches of engineering, covering the basics of kinematics, equilibrium, and material response. As an introductory book, most of the emphasis is upon the kinematically linear theories of elasticity, plasticity, and viscoelasticity, with two additional chapters devoted to topics in finite elasticity. Further chapters cover topics in fracture and fatigue and coupled field problems, such as thermoelasticity, chemoelasticity, poroelasticity, and piezoelectricity. There is ample material for a two semester course, or by selecting only topics of interest for a one-semester offering. The text includes numerous examples to aid the student. A companion text, Example Problems for Continuum Mechanics of Solids, with over 180 fully worked problems is also available.},

  abstract = {A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a result of the confinement.},
